# Chatbot Project
***
Final project for 25SP IA Python at UT Austin
## How it works
***
### Here is an example:
Choose your chatbot:
1. Friendly Bot
2. Teacher Bot
3. Girlfriend Bot
Enter 1 or 2 or 3: 1

Kaiyuan: Hello! How can I help you today? (type '/help' to see more)

You: tell me a joke

Kaiyuan: 😊 Hi there! I'd be happy to share a joke with you! 🤣 Here it goes: Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? 🤔 Because it was two-tired! 😂

Need another one? Just ask! 🤗 You can choose from:
👍 A joke about animals
👎 A joke about food

Which one would you like? 🤔 [*save your changes*] 

Remember, I'm here to help and make you smile! 😊

You: /switch

What subject should I teach? Computer Science

Switched successfully! Now you are talking with Prof. Zhang.

You: I want to do research about MLSys. What is it?

Prof. Zhang: 📚 [Concept Map]
To start with, let's break down what MLSys is. MLSys stands for Machine Learning Systems, which is a subfield of Computer Science that focuses on the development and deployment of machine learning models in real-world systems. This involves designing, building, and optimizing systems that can learn from data and improve over time.

The concept of MLSys can be visualized as a pipeline that includes data collection, data preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and model monitoring. Each stage of the pipeline is crucial to ensure that the system is accurate, reliable, and efficient.

👨‍🏫 [Key Principles]
The key principles of MLSys involve:

1. **Machine Learning**: This is the core component of MLSys, which involves training models on data to make predictions or take actions.
2. **System Design**: This involves designing the overall architecture of the system, including the data pipeline, model deployment, and monitoring.
3. **Scalability**: MLSys requires systems to be scalable, so they can handle large amounts of data and traffic.
4. **Reliability**: The system must be reliable and fault-tolerant, to ensure that it can operate continuously without downtime.

📊 [Example]
A real-world example of MLSys is a recommendation system used by e-commerce companies. The system collects data on user behavior, such as search queries, clicks, and purchases. The data is then preprocessed and used to train a machine learning model that recommends products to users. The model is deployed in a scalable and reliable system that can handle a large volume of traffic.

💻 [Walkthrough]
To get started with researching MLSys, you can follow these steps:

1. **Learn the basics of machine learning**: Start by learning the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning.
2. **Study system design**: Learn about system design principles, including scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
3. **Explore real-world applications**: Look at real-world examples of MLSys, such as recommendation systems, natural language processing, and computer vision.
4. **Read research papers**: Read research papers on MLSys to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and advancements in the field.

📝 [Self-Test Quiz]
To reinforce your understanding of MLSys, try answering the following questions:

What is the primary focus of MLSys?

    a) Developing machine learning models
    
    b) Deploying machine learning models in real-world systems
    
    c) Collecting and preprocessing data
   
    d) Monitoring and maintaining machine learning models

Answer: b) Deploying machine learning models in real-world systems

What is the importance of scalability in MLSys?
    
    a) To handle small amounts of data
    
    b) To handle large amounts of data and traffic
   
    c) To reduce the complexity of the system
    
    d) To increase the cost of the system

Answer: b) To handle large amounts of data and traffic

Review Timeline:
- Week 1-2: Review the basics of machine learning and system design
- Week 3-4: Explore real-world applications of MLSys
- Week 5-6: Read research papers on MLSys and take the self-test quiz

Remember, understanding MLSys is a continuous process that requires practice, patience, and persistence. Stay motivated, and you'll be well on your way to becoming an expert in this exciting field! 💪
